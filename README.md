# Getting Started with Discourse API Documentation

## Introduction

This page contains the documentation on how to use Discourse through API calls.

> Note: For any endpoints not listed you can follow the
> [reverse engineer the Discourse API](https://meta.discourse.org/t/-/20576)
> guide to figure out how to use an API endpoint.

### Request Content-Type

The Content-Type for POST and PUT requests can be set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,
`multipart/form-data`, or `application/json`.

### Endpoint Names and Response Content-Type

Most API endpoints provide the same content as their HTML counterparts. For example
the URL `/categories` serves a list of categories, the `/categories.json` API provides the
same information in JSON format.

Instead of sending API requests to `/categories.json` you may also send them to `/categories`
and add an `Accept: application/json` header to the request to get the JSON response.
Sending requests with the `Accept` header is necessary if you want to use URLs
for related endpoints returned by the API, such as pagination URLs.
These URLs are returned without the `.json` prefix so you need to add the header in
order to get the correct response format.

### Authentication

Some endpoints do not require any authentication, pretty much anything else will
require you to be authenticated.

To become authenticated you will need to create an API Key from the admin panel.

Once you have your API Key you can pass it in along with your API Username
as an HTTP header like this:

```
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin/users/list/active.json" \
-H "Api-Key: 714552c6148e1617aeab526d0606184b94a80ec048fc09894ff1a72b740c5f19" \
-H "Api-Username: system"
```

and this is how POST requests will look:

```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:3000/categories" \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data;" \
-H "Api-Key: 714552c6148e1617aeab526d0606184b94a80ec048fc09894ff1a72b740c5f19" \
-H "Api-Username: system" \
-F "name=89853c20-4409-e91a-a8ea-f6cdff96aaaa" \
-F "color=49d9e9" \
-F "text_color=f0fcfd"
```

### Boolean values

If an endpoint accepts a boolean be sure to specify it as a lowercase
`true` or `false` value unless noted otherwise.

## Building

### Requirements

The SDK relies on **Node.js** and **npm** (to resolve dependencies). It also requires **Typescript version >=4.1**. You can download and install Node.js and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

> **NOTE:** npm is installed by default when Node.js is installed.

### Verify Successful Installation

Run the following commands in the command prompt or shell of your choice to check if Node.js and npm are successfully installed:

* Node.js: `node --version`

* npm: `npm --version`

![Version Check](https://apidocs.io/illustration/typescript?workspaceFolder=DiscourseApiDocumentation&step=versionCheck)

### Install Dependencies

- To resolve all dependencies, go to the **SDK root directory** and run the following command with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

- This will install all dependencies in the **node_modules** folder.

![Resolve Dependencies](https://apidocs.io/illustration/typescript?workspaceFolder=DiscourseApiDocumentation&workspaceName=discourse-api-documentationlib&step=resolveDependency)

## Installation

The following section explains how to use the generated library in a new project.

### 1. Initialize the Node Project

- Open an IDE/text editor for JavaScript like Visual Studio Code. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

- Click on **File** and select **Open Folder**. Select an empty folder of your project, the folder will become visible in the sidebar on the left.

![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/typescript?step=openProject)

- To initialize the Node project, click on **Terminal** and select **New Terminal**. Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm init --y
```

### 2. Add Dependencies to the Client Library

- The created project manages its dependencies using its `package.json` file. In order to add a dependency on the *Discourse API DocumentationLib* client library, double click on the `package.json` file in the bar on the left and add the dependency to the package in it.

![Add DiscourseApiDocumentationlib Dependency](https://apidocs.io/illustration/typescript?workspaceFolder=DiscourseApiDocumentation&workspaceName=discourse-api-documentationlib&step=importDependency)

- To install the package in the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| defaultHost | `string` | *Default*: `'discourse.example.com'` |
| environment | [`Environment`](README.md#environments) | The API environment. <br> **Default: `Environment.Production`** |
| timeout | `number` | Timeout for API calls.<br>*Default*: `30000` |
| httpClientOptions | [`Partial<HttpClientOptions>`](doc/http-client-options.md) | Stable configurable http client options. |
| unstableHttpClientOptions | `any` | Unstable configurable http client options. |
| logging | [`PartialLoggingOptions`](doc/partial-logging-options.md) | Logging Configuration to enable logging |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

### Code-Based Client Initialization

```ts
import {
  Client,
  Environment,
  LogLevel,
} from 'discourse-api-documentationlib';

const client = new Client({
  timeout: 30000,
  environment: Environment.Production,
  logging: {
    logLevel: LogLevel.Info,
    logRequest: {
      logBody: true
    },
    logResponse: {
      logHeaders: true
    }
  },
  defaultHost: 'discourse.example.com',
});
```

### Configuration-Based Client Initialization

```ts
import * as path from 'path';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { Client } from 'discourse-api-documentationlib';

// Provide absolute path for the configuration file
const absolutePath = path.resolve('./config.json');

// Read the configuration file content
const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, 'utf-8');

// Initialize client from JSON configuration content
const client = Client.fromJsonConfig(fileContent);
```

See the [Configuration-Based Client Initialization](doc/configuration-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.

### Environment-Based Client Initialization

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { Client } from 'discourse-api-documentationlib';

// Optional - Provide absolute path for the .env file
const absolutePath = path.resolve('./.env');

if (fs.existsSync(absolutePath)) {
  // Load environment variables from .env file
  dotenv.config({ path: absolutePath, override: true });
}

// Initialize client using environment variables
const client = Client.fromEnvironment(process.env);
```

See the [Environment-Based Client Initialization](doc/environment-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.
